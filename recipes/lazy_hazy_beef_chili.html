<p>
  Despite all the shortcuts, this lazy hazy beef chili is tremendously
  delicious. For a little-to-no work beef chili, this lacks for nothing. Chunky
  salsa does all the chopping for you, and the hazy IPA adds a subtle
  bitterness, a little acidity, and a certain something nobody will be able to
  pick out. As everybody knows, the most fun part of cheating is getting away
  with it.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>pounds ground beef</li>

  <li>tablespoons chili powder, or to taste</li>

  <li>1/4 teaspoon ground chipotle</li>

  <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

  <li>teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>

  <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

  <li>12 ounces hazy IPA beer</li>

  <li>teaspoons white sugar</li>

  <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

  <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

  <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced fire-roasted tomatoes with green chilies</li>

  <li>(16 ounce jars) extra chunky salsa</li>

  <li>(15 ounce) cans pinto beans, drained</li>
</ul>
<h2>Toppings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
  <li>1/2 cup sliced green onions</li>
  <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
  <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Add beef to a dry cold pot, and turn heat to high.</li>
  <li>
    When beef begins to sizzle, break up into small pieces with a potato masher
    or spatula. Meat can be broken up into very fine crumbles, or into larger
    chunks, depending on the desired texture. Continue to cook and break up beef
    until no longer pink, about 7 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add chili powder, chipotle, black pepper, salt, and cinnamon to the pot.
    Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, then pour in beer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pot as you do. Let
    mixture boil until liquid is reduced by about half, 2 to 3 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add sugar, oregano, garlic powder, diced tomatoes and jarred salsa. Stir in;
    return mixture to a simmer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir in beans, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally,
    until chili is thickened and flavor is developed to your liking, about 1
    hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    Taste, adjust the seasoning. Top with sour cream, green onions, Cheddar
    cheese, and cilantro as desired.
  </li>
</ol>
